# hello-transfer

A hello world for neural network transfer learning on real/computer-generated images. This builds on hello-mnist's digit recognition neural net and indeed uses the model generated from it.

This model- instead of recognizing a digit- will instead be directed towards learning the difference between handwritten digits and computer generated digits. Ideally, this will be extended to computer generated letters as well, though that will take some deeper understanding of what is being seen at each layer of the neural network.
